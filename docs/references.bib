abstract = "This work is devoted to the numerical simulation of a Vlasov–Poisson model describing a charged particle beam under the action of a rapidly oscillating external field. We construct an Asymptotic Preserving numerical scheme for this kinetic equation in the highly oscillatory limit. This scheme enables to simulate the problem without using any time step refinement technique. Moreover, since our numerical method is not based on the derivation of the simulation of asymptotic models, it works in the regime where the solution does not oscillate rapidly, and in the highly oscillatory regime as well. Our method is based on a “two scale” reformulation of the initial equation, with the introduction of an additional periodic variable."

author = "S.M. Cox and P.C. Matthews",
abstract = "We develop a class of numerical methods for stiff systems, based on the method of exponential time differencing. We describe schemes with second- and higher-order accuracy, introduce new Runge–Kutta versions of these schemes, and extend the method to show how it may be applied to systems whose linear part is nondiagonal. We test the method against other common schemes, including integrating factor and linearly implicit methods, and show how it is more accurate in a number of applications. We apply the method to both dissipative and dispersive partial differential equations, after illustrating its behavior using forced ordinary differential equations with stiff linear parts."
